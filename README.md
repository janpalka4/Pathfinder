# Pathfinder - Pathfinding Algorithm Visualization
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

**Pathfinder** is a web application designed to visualize pathfinding algorithms, offering an interactive and intuitive way to understand their workings. Currently, it supports the visualization of **Dijkstra's algorithm** and maze generation using the **Kruskal's Maze algorithm**.

This application is still under development (preview version) and may contain bugs or incomplete features.

## Features

### Pathfinding Algorithms
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**:  
  - One of the most popular algorithms for finding the shortest path in a graph.
  - The app allows you to visualize how the algorithm explores the graph step by step, from the starting point to the destination.

### Maze Generation
- **Kruskal's Maze Algorithm**:  
  - A maze generation algorithm based on the minimum spanning tree concept.
  - Every maze is unique thanks to the algorithm's random nature.

## Want to try?
- Visit the Github pages of the app

## Planned Features
- Support for additional pathfinding algorithms:
- A* Algorithm
- BFS (Breadth-First Search)
- DFS (Depth-First Search)
- Performance optimizations and bug fixes.

# Known Issues and Limitations
- The UI is not optimized for mobile devices.
- The UI has issues when resizing browser window (working on fix).
